# About My Work

I'm the solo developer behind all the Unreal Engine plugins featured on this website. Each plugin represents months of dedicated work, from concept to implementation, focusing on solving real-world game development challenges that I've encountered in my own projects.

## Current Focus: Professional Plugin Development

All the plugins showcased on this site - from the Ability Queue System to the Easy Skeletal Mesh Merge Async - are my independent creations. I believe in building tools that not only solve problems but also enhance the development workflow for fellow game developers.

### Featured Projects:
- **Easy Hit Trail System** - Modular hit detection system
- **Ability Queue System** - Extension of Epic's Gameplay Ability System
- **Nested Inventory Architecture** - Customizable inventory solutions
- **Modular Action System** - Data-driven action framework
- **Easy Skeletal Mesh Merge Async** - Optimized character modularization
- **Easy Ability Set System** - Streamlined ability management

## Development Philosophy

I focus on creating solutions that are:
- **Performance-oriented**: Optimized for production use
- **Developer-friendly**: Easy to integrate and customize
- **Well-documented**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- **Community-driven**: Built based on real developer needs

# Development Journey

## Education & Early Experience
Started my journey in Computer Engineering at Marmara University, Turkey in 2019. Founded and led the Marmara Game Development Club, organizing game jams, workshops, and educational events for aspiring developers.

## Professional Experience
### Retter Business Services (RBS)
- **Intern & Junior Developer**: Gained valuable experience in business management, software development, and customer communication
- **Technical Skills**: JavaScript backend development, test automation with Cypress, documentation writing
- **Soft Skills**: Team collaboration, project management, client interaction

### Solo Game Development Journey
Since 2020, I've been developing **Hermod's Ride**, a topdown medieval slasher multiplayer arena game. This project serves as both a creative outlet and a testing ground for the systems and plugins I develop.

## Current Status: Open to Work

I'm actively seeking new opportunities in game development, particularly roles involving:
- C++ Gameplay Programming
- Unreal Engine development
- Tool and plugin creation
- System architecture and optimization

# Development Insights & Devlogs

This blog will regularly feature:
- **Plugin Development Insights**: Behind-the-scenes look at how I create and optimize plugins
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Detailed explanations of complex systems and solutions
- **Industry Observations**: Thoughts on game development trends and best practices
- **Project Updates**: Progress reports on Hermod's Ride and new plugin developments
- **Community Interactions**: Responses to feedback and feature requests

# Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to discuss game development, share knowledge, and explore collaboration opportunities. Whether you're interested in my plugins, want to chat about Unreal Engine development, or have questions about any of my projects, feel free to reach out!
