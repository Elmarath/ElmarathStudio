All the tutorials will be updated whenever a feature changes in the related Plug-In.

My Personal request from you is to leave a **review** or **question** about this plug-in in the Epic Marketplace. 

![Docs Version Dropdown](./img/T_MarketplaceExample.png)


## Feedback

You can always hop on the  **[Discord](https://discord.gg/HghXuWHJJx)** to ask questions. 


### All The Plug-ins Aim:

- Creating **modular pieces** to be used in every project. To do so, your reviews are really important for this process.
- **Optimization** is always a high priority considiration while designing.
- **Blueprints** are always the places where the main logic is handled. C++ is used for only exposing some of the functionalities that blurpints don't have. This way you can always look at the plug-in file's to see what is being handled how.
- **Readablility** is always considered for the end user and for the development.

## What We Expect From You

Plug-ins are not *Started Packs* that you can use from the get go. You should always implement your own logic to create your own system.
For example you need to create child of blueprint classes, or orginize data assets to what your game needs.
So systems needs some work in order to be integreted to your project. *So you need to be familiar with the Engine Default Assets*.

Also if you find any bugs or features missing, you can let us know in the discord.

That's said, Good Luck with your Game!
