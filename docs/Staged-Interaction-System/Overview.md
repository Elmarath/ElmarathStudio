## Overview

**Staged Interaction System** is a *lightweight*, *flexible*, and *modular* *runtime interaction framework* for Unreal Engine that supports both *indication* and *gameplay interactions* in single-player and *multiplayer* games. By breaking interactions into clear, designer-friendly **stages**, the system makes it dramatically easier to communicate intent to players and implement gameplay logic.

**Indication stages** let you create visuals such as proximity-based outlines, hover effects, or shared feedback that shows when other players are interacting with an object. **Gameplay stages** enable reliable, conflict-free interaction logic—such as determining what happens when multiple players or AI characters attempt to interact with the same object.

Everything is fully customizable and can be built using Blueprints, State Trees, or your preferred gameplay logic.

### ⭐ Key Benefits

- **Easy to implement:** Minimal setup to get staged interactions working in your project.
- **Modular, reusable logic:** Build stage behaviours that can be shared across actors and projects.
- **Multiplayer support:** Designed to work in both single-player and networked games.
- **Fully customizable:** Architect interactions using Blueprints, State Trees, or code.
- **Debugger included:** Visual runtime tools to inspect stages, interactors, and conflicts.

### 🎮 Typical Use Cases

- Multi-user interactions with a single actor (or restricting to a single interactor).
- Interaction indicators (e.g., "Press E to interact").
- Reusable interaction behaviours for different actor types.
- AI-driven interactions with actors.
