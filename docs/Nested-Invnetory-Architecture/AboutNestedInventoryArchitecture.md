:::note
    **NIA** *-as the name suggests-* is an architecture, it allows you to build your inventory based on a well designed structre and **it doesn't restrict the way you edit them**. There are already defined some basic functions such as: *Add*, *TransformSlots*, *Discard*, *SetSlot*" etc. But you can **override** them, or **create new editing methods from scratch**!
:::

## This System Gives You:

 - **Nested Inventory System** will allow items to hold other inventories! Backpacks within packpacks, weapon attachments inside weapons... Everything is possible!

 - **Object Based Architecture** makes possible to make use of inheritance for primitive item types and hold runtime variables for items. Everything an object can do.

 - **[Data Asset](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-assets-in-unreal-engine) Use For Base Info** allows items to hold customized variables types per class with the help of inheritance and many other advantages of using data assets.

 - **Sections as [GameplayTags](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Tags/)** used for Inventories that hold sections with different types. Allowing item transform in a much more intuitive manner. Allowing logics like: *If item tag and section tag matches* etc.
- **Customizable Inventory Editing** is always available by *overriding* the related methods or *create* new ones for your project, **Blueprints** or **C++**!
