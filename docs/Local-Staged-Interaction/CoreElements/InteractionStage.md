# Interaction Stage

An **Interaction Stage** refers to a pairing of a `Gameplay Tag` (the key) and its associated `InteractionStage` UObject (the value). These pairs are stored as entries in a map within the `Staged Interaction Component`.

The **Gameplay Tag** acts as the unique identifier (ID) for the interaction stage. You can optionally configure special tags in the **Project Settings** under **Local Staged Interaction**.

The **InteractionStage** UObject instance holds the logic and conditions that determine whether a tag can be applied to an actor. Developers can also create custom subclasses of `InteractionStage` to include additional data or complex rules.

Each `InteractionStage` contains an array of **Interaction Stage Conditions**, and **all conditions must pass** for the stage to be successfully added.

## ðŸŽ¯ Interaction Stage Condition

An **Interaction Stage Condition** is a simple, blueprintable `UObject` used within an `InteractionStage`. Its purpose is to decide whether a particular interaction stage can be applied.

It does this through the following function:

```cpp
EInteractionStageConditionPass CanExecuteStageCondition_Native
    (UInteractionStageBase* Stage, FGameplayTag InteractionStageTag,
    UStageInteractionComponentBase* OwnerInteractionComponentBase,
    EInteractionStageConditionCheckingTime InCheckingTime);

// EInteractionStageConditionPass (Apply,Continue,Fail,None)
```

This function checks if the condition is met, based on the current context (such as the component and tag involved). The system automatically evaluates conditions whenever an interaction stage is **added or removed**. If a condition becomes invalid at any point, the stage is removed automatically from the component.

:::note
**Checking Time Matters**

Each condition defines a **Checking Time**, which controls when the condition is evaluated:

- **Always**
- **On Stage Added**
- **On Stage Removed**

For example:
You might only want to add the "Interacted" stage when the actor is **overlapped**, but not necessarily remove it immediately when overlap endsâ€”such as in the case of a **light switch** or **door trigger**.

This gives you full control over **when and how** interaction conditions are validated.
