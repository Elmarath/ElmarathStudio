# Easy Ability Set System for Gameplay Ability System

The **Easy Ability Set System** is a [Lyra](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.5)-inspired, lightweight plugin that extends Unreal Engineâ€™s [**Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-ability-system-for-unreal-engine). It lets you easily define, grant, clear, and manage groups of abilities at runtimeâ€”no more assigning abilities one by one!
