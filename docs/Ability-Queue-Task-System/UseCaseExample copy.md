# Final Notes

## Debugging

To enable the runtime debug view, run this in the in-game console:

`AbilityQueue.EnableDebugMode 1`

The debug view shows the currently playing ability, its active state and priority, plus queued requests and their priorities. Use this to verify state transitions, queue ordering, and lifetime behavior while you tune the system.

## Final Words

Thanks for using the Ability Queue Task System. The plugin is designed to make ability flows more responsive and modular without forcing changes to your existing GAS setup.
